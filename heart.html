                They say that every day, the universe expands</p>
               <p>and we discover certain things that we don't understand.</p>
               <p></p> Dark matter ain't the only mystery at hand.</p>
               <p></p> I'm wond'rin' how I got a girl like you to say that I'm her man.</p>
                <br/>
               <p>It's a statistical anomaly, but girl, you've got me.</p>
               <p>Gravity is pulling me to your heavenly body.</p>
               <p>No astronomical phenomenon could ever stop me.</p>
               <p>You've got a smile that every star in the galaxy copied.</p>
               <br/>
               <p>The constellations couldn't make as beautiful a pattern.</p>
               <p>The conversationsâ€”every night, I ring you up like Saturn.</p>
               <p>The telescopes tell us folks that you're the coolest view.</p>
               <p>A supernova's scootin' over to make room for you</p>
               <br/>
               <p>'cause you eclipse every wonder of the cosmos.</p>
               <p>It's almost unfair to them, but you're the one I want most.</p>
               <p>It's a miracle that Galileo never found you.</p>
               <p>If he did, he'd say the universe revolved around you.</p>
